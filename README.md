# 🧾 Smart Tax Refund Estimator

Welcome to the **Smart Tax Refund Estimator** — a simple, fast, and accurate tool built to give everyday taxpayers a head start on their refund expectations **before tax season even hits**.

Whether you're a W-2 employee, a single parent, or filing jointly, this app gives you a clear estimate of how much you're owed based on basic info you already know.

## 💼 Who This Is For

This tool is designed for:
- W-2 earners wondering if they're getting a refund this year
- People adjusting their W-4 and wanting to see the impact
- Tax clients who want a **free, no-pressure preview** before booking a consult
- Anyone who says “I don’t know what I’ll get back this year…”

## 🚀 What It Does

With just your:
- Income
- Federal tax withheld
- Filing status

The app estimates your federal tax liability and refund using a simplified calculation — giving you a ballpark figure within seconds.

This is **not** a replacement for professional tax filing. It’s a **conversation starter**, a planning tool, and a lead magnet — all rolled into one.

## ✨ Why I Built This

I built this because people always ask me the same thing every January:

> “Can you just tell me if I’m getting anything back?”

Now, instead of waiting until February or scrambling for pay stubs, they can run the numbers in under 60 seconds — and then book a real appointment when it makes sense.
